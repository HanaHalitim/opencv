- JSON Schema: [Link to JSON Schema]
- XML Schema: [Link to XML Schema]

## Reusability

The OpenCV project provides rich descriptions and detailed documentation to facilitate reuse. The project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

## Provenance

The OpenCV project is a collaborative effort led by Gary Bradski. It builds upon previous work in computer vision and robotics.

## FAIR4RS Principles

1. **Findable**
   - Added machine-readable metadata and assigned globally unique identifiers.
   - Metadata example:
     ```yaml
     title: OpenCV Project
     identifier: doi:10.1234/opencv-project
     description: An open-source computer vision library.
     creators: 
       - name: Gary Bradski
         affiliation: Industrial Perception
         email: gbradski@example.com
     ```

2. **Accessible**
   - Ensured software can be accessed via standard protocols and included necessary authentication.

3. **Interoperable**
   - Used formal, shared languages for knowledge representation to ensure interoperability.

4. **Reusable**
   - Provided rich descriptions, clear usage licenses, and detailed provenance information.
